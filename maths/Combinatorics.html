          Combinatorics is the branch of Mathematics dealing with the study of
          finite or countable discrete structures. It includes the enumeration
          or counting of objects having certain properties. Counting helps us
          solve several types of problems such as counting the number of
          available IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

        <h4>Counting Principles –</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="para1">
        <p>
          There are two basic counting principles, sum rule and product rule.
          <br />

          Sum Rule – If a task can be done in one of n<span class="sub">1</span>
          ways or one of n<span class="sub">2</span> ways, where none of the set
          of n<span class="sub">1</span> ways is the same as any of the set of
          n<span class="sub">2</span> ways, then there are n<span class="sub"
            >1</span
          >
          + n<span class="sub">2</span> ways to do the task. <br />

          Product Rule – If a task can be broken down into a sequence of k
          subtasks, where each subtask can be performed in n<span class="sub"
            >1</span
          >, n<span class="sub">2</span>,.. n<span class="sub">k</span>
          respectively, then the total number of ways the task can be performed
          is n<span class="sub">1</span><span class="mul">*</span> n<span
            class="sub"
            >2</span
          >
          <span class="mul">*</span> ... <span class="mul">*</span> n<span
            class="sub"
            >k</span
          >
          . <br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para1">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Example 1 – In how many ways can 3 winning prizes be given to the
            top 3 players in a game played by 12 players?
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Solution – We have to distribute 3 prizes among 12 players. This
            task can be divided into 3 subtasks of assigning a single prize to a
            certain player. Giving out the first prize can be done in 12
            different ways. After giving out the first prize, two prizes remain
            and 11 players remain. Similarly, the second prize and third prize
            can be given in 11 ways and 10 ways. The total number of ways by the
            product rule is 12 <span class="mul">*</span> 11
            <span class="mul">*</span> 10 = 1320.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Example 2 – In how many ways can a person choose a project from
            three lists of projects of sizes 10, 15, and 19 respectively?
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Solution – The person has a choice of choosing a project from either
            of the three lists. So the person can choose from either 10 projects
            or 15 projects or 19 projects. Since choosing from one list is not
            the same as choosing another list, the total number of ways of
            choosing a project by the sum-rule is 10 + 15 + 19 = 44.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Example 3 – How many distinct license plates are possible in the
            given format- Two alphabets in uppercase, followed by two digits
            then a hyphen and finally four digits. Sample- AB12-3456.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Solution – There are 26 possibilities for the each of the two
            letters and 10 possibilities for each of the digits. Therefore the
            total number of possibilities is – 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10
            * 10 = 676000000.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Example 4 – How many variable names of length upto 3 exist if the
            variable names are alphanumeric and case sensitive with the
            restriction that the first character has to be an alphabet?
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Solution – Let N<span class="sub">1</span>, N<span class="sub"
              >2</span
            >, and N<span class="sub">3</span> denote the number of possible
            variable names of length 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, total number of
            variable names is N<span class="sub">1</span> + N<span class="sub"
              >2</span
            >
            + N<span class="sub">3</span> . For N<span class="sub">1</span>
            there are only 52 possibilities since the first character has to be
            an alphabet. For N<span class="sub">2</span> , there are 52
            <span class="mul">*</span> 62 = 3224 possibilities For N<span
              class="sub"
              >1</span
            >
            , there are 52 <span class="mul">*</span> 62
            <span class="mul">*</span> 62 = 199888 possibilities Therefore,
            total number of variable names = 52 + 3224 + 199888 = 203164

        <h4>Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion :</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="para1">
        <p>
          The sum-rule mentioned above states that if there are multiple sets of
          ways of doing a task, there shouldn’t be any way that is common
          between two sets of ways because if there is, it would be counted
          twice and the enumeration would be wrong. <br />
          The principle of inclusion-exclusion says that in order to count only
          unique ways of doing a task, we must add the number of ways to do it
          in one way and the number of ways to do it in another and then
          subtract the number of ways to do the task that are common to both
          sets of ways. <br />
          The principle of inclusion-exclusion is also known as the subtraction
          principle. For two sets of ways A<span class="sub">1</span> and A<span
            class="sub"
            >2</span
          >
          , the enumeration would like- <br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="../images/Combination.JPG" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="para1">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Example 1 – How many binary strings of length 8 either start with a
            ‘1’ bit or end with two bits ’00’?
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Solution – If the string starts with one, there are 7 characters
            left which can be filled in 2<spam class="sup">7</spam> = 128 ways.
            If the string ends with ’00’ then 6 characters can be filled in
            2<spam class="sup">6</spam> = 64 ways. Now if we add the above sets
            of ways and conclude that it is the final answer, then it would be
            wrong. This is because there are strings with start with ‘1’ and end
            with ’00’ both, and since they satisfy both criteria they are
            counted twice. So we need to subtract such strings to get a correct
            count. Strings that start with ‘1’ and end with ’00’ have five
            characters that can be filled in 2<spam class="sup">7</spam> = 32
            ways. So by the inclusion-exclusion principle we get- Total strings
            = 128 + 64 – 32 = 160
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Example 2 – How many numbers between 1 and 1000, including both, are
            divisible by 3 or 4?
          </li> <br>
          <li>Solution – Number of numbers divisible by 3 = |A<span class="sub">1</span>|  =[1000/3] = 333  .  <br>
            Number of numbers divisible by 4 = |A<span class="sub">2</span>|  = [1000/4] = 250  . <br>
            Number of numbers divisible by 3 and 4 = |A<span class="sub">1</span> &#x222A; A<span class="sub">2</span>|  = [1000/12] = 83  . <br>
            Therefore, number of numbers divisible by 3 or 4 = |A<span class="sub">1</span> &#x222A; A<span class="sub">2</span>|  = 333 + 250 – 83 = 500</li> <br>
